            <h2>About me</h2>

            <img src="images/me.png" alt="yowhatup! It's me!">
            <p>My full name is <b>Kevin Joseph Doucette</b> and I live in <em>Vernon&#44; Ontario</em>. But that does
                not appear on google maps&#44; So I just tell people I live in <em>Osgoode&#44; Ontario.</em>
            </p>
            <p>I am currently 29 years old and I’ve been working dead end retail jobs since around
                <strong>2011</strong>&#44; and after being
                <em>sick and fed&hyphen;up</em> with that I decided to go back to school to further my education.</p>
            <p>
                I was not too sure how I would feel about the course. I took a few of those online surveys to find out
                what college course you should take&#44; and this course&#44; or course&#39;s like it&#44; appeared in
                the top of the list
                often. The class I was most worried about was this one. I took some coding classes in high school and I
                tried to learn some game <abbr title="development">dev</abbr> coding on my own time and I just could not
                get into it. Everything just
                felt to strict. But so far&#44; I am really enjoying this class. It feels more open and freer then the
                <abbr title="a different coding language">c++</abbr> coding I was used to.
                I’m looking forward to continuing with this course and seeing where it will take me and what other
                courses will grab me like this one does.
            </p>
