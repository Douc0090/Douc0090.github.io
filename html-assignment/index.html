            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My full name is Kevin Joseph Doucette and I live in <em>Vernon, Ontario</em>. But that does not appear on google
                maps, So I just tell people I live in <em>Osgoode, Ontario.</em>
            </p>
            <p>I am currently 29 years old and I’ve been working dead end retail jobs since around <strong>2011</strong>, and after being
                sick and fed&hyphen;up with that I decided to go back to school to further my education.</p>
            <p>
                I was not too sure how I would feel about the course. I took a few of those online surveys to find out
                what college class you should take and this course, or course like it, appeared in the top of the list
                often. The class I was most worried about was this one. I took some coding classes in high school and I
                tried to learn some game dev coding on my own time and I just could not get into it. Everything just
                felt to strict. But so far, I am really enjoying this class. It feels more open and freer then the <abbr
                    title="a different coding language">c++</abbr> coding I was used to.
                I’m looking forward to continuing with this course and seeing where it will take me and what other
                courses will grab me like this one does.
